      Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
      through some interesting places on the way:    
      <ol>
       <li>	walla walla,WA</li>
       <li>Magic City,ID</li>
       <li>Boutiful,UT</li>
       <li>Last Chance,CO</li>
       <li>Truth or Consequences,
 NM</li>
       </li>whyAZ</li>
      </ol>
      
    </p>

      I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the
      road today:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Passing cars,
      When you can't see,
      May get you,
      A glimpse,
      Of eternity. 
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I definitely won't be passing any cars.
    </p>

    <p>
      My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got
      everything packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway,
      I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
      <ul>
      <li>cellphone</li>
      <li>ipod</li>
      <li>digital camera</li>
      <li>and a proteinbar</li>
      </ul>
      Just the essentials.  As
      Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a 
      thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
